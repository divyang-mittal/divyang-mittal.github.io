### Welcome!

A few decades ago, supercomputers such as Cray-1 and Cyber 205 had capabilities such as vector processing. With time all
these enhancements have been incorporated into personal computers. Modern supercomputers are hence made up of a large number of such processors. According to
<a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2022/06/" target="_blank">top500</a>, the list of the fastest
supercomputers of June 2022 is dominated by computer clusters such as Frontier, Fugaku. According to that list, Frontier is the fastest
supercomputer and consists of 9408 computational nodes. In the second position, Fugaku has an
exceptional 158,976 computational nodes. This is evidence enough to understand the potential of distributed computing.

### About me

I work as a Software Engineer in the data platform team at AppDynamics. I design and develop microservices that handle millions of packets every second.
My contribution includes creating a library used company-wide to create SLI for microservices.
I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>.
My research interest lies in computer systems, and I wish to pursue a career as an industrial researcher.
