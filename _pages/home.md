### Welcome!

A few decades ago, supercomputers such as Cray-1 and Cyber 205 had capabilities such as vector processing. With time all
these enhancements have been incorporated into personal computers. Modern supercomputers are hence made up of a large number of such processors. According to
<a href="https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2022/06/" target="_blank">top500</a>, the list of the fastest
supercomputers of June 2022 is dominated by computer clusters such as Frontier, Fugaku. According to that list, Frontier is the fastest
supercomputer and consists of 9408 computational nodes. In the second position, Fugaku has an
exceptional 158,976 computational nodes. This is evidence enough to understand the potential of distributed computing.

### About me

I am currently a Master of Science in Computer Science student at Columbia University, pursuing the software systems track. I have worked as a Software Developer in the Data Platform team at Cisco AppDynamics for two years. I worked as a backend developer where I took charge of end-to-end development of features, ranging from design, development to deployment. I worked with microservices that handle millions of packets every second.
My contributions include developing a two-level cache system for our services; creating a library used company-wide to create SLI for microservices; Remodeling the API calls and adding support for pagination and resiliency against multiple call failures. I worked with JAVA, Apache Kafka, Kubernetes, Micronaut, Prometheus, FluentBit, AWS, etc.
I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>.
